    "## GraphSage Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's start working on our own implementation of layers! This part is to get you familiar with how to implement Pytorch layer based on Message Passing. You will be implementing the **forward**, **message** and **aggregate** functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, the **forward** function is where the actual message passing is conducted. All logic in each iteration happens in **forward**, where we'll call **propagate** function to propagate information from neighbor nodes to central nodes.  So the general paradigm will be pre-processing -> propagate -> post-processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the process of message passing we introduced in homework 1. **propagate** further calls **message** which transforms information of neighbor nodes into messages, **aggregate** which aggregates all messages from neighbor nodes into one, and **update** which further generates the embedding for nodes in the next iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our implementation is slightly variant from this, where we'll not explicitly implement **update**, but put the logic for updating nodes in **forward** function. To be more specific, after information is propagated, we can further conduct some operations on the output of **propagate**. The output of **forward** is exactly the embeddings after the current iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, tensors passed to **propagate()** can be mapped to the respective nodes $i$ and $j$ by appending _i or _j to the variable name, .e.g. x_i and x_j. Note that we generally refer to $i$ as the central nodes that aggregates information, and refer to $j$ as the neighboring nodes, since this is the most common notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please find more details in the comments. One thing to note is that we're adding **skip connections** to our GraphSage. Formally, the update rule for our model is described as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "h_v^{(l)} = W_l\\cdot h_v^{(l-1)} + W_r \\cdot AGG(\\{h_u^{(l-1)}, \\forall u \\in N(v) \\})\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we use mean aggregations where:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "AGG(\\{h_u^{(l-1)}, \\forall u \\in N(v) \\}) = \\frac{1}{|N(v)|} \\sum_{u\\in N(v)} h_u^{(l-1)}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, $\\ell$-2 normalization is applied after each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to complete the work correctly, we have to understand how the different functions interact with each other. In **propagate** we can pass in any parameters we want. For example, we pass in $x$ as an parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "... = propagate(..., $x$=($x_{central}$, $x_{neighbor}$), ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $x_{central}$ and $x_{neighbor}$ represent the features from **central** nodes and from **neighbor** nodes. If we're using the same representations from central and neighbor, then $x_{central}$ and $x_{neighbor}$ could be identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $x_{central}$ and $x_{neighbor}$ are both of shape N * d, where N is number of nodes, and d is dimension of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then in message function, we can take parameters called $x\\_i$ and $x\\_j$. Usually $x\\_i$ represents \"central nodes\", and $x\\_j$ represents \"neighbor nodes\". Pay attention to the shape here: $x\\_i$ and $x\\_j$ are both of shape E * d (**not N!**). $x\\_i$ is obtained by concatenating the embeddings of central nodes of all edges through lookups from $x_{central}$ we passed in propagate. Similarly, $x\\_j$ is obtained by concatenating the embeddings of neighbor nodes of all edges through lookups from $x_{neighbor}$ we passed in propagate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example. Suppose we have 4 nodes, so $x_{central}$ and $x_{neighbor}$ are of shape 4 * d. We have two edges (1, 2) and (3, 0). Thus, $x\\_i$ is obtained by $[x_{central}[1]^T; x_{central}[3]^T]^T$, and $x\\_j$ is obtained by $[x_{neighbor}[2]^T; x_{neighbor}[0]^T]^T$\n",

One of the major benefits of attention-based mechanisms is their ability to focus on the most relevant parts of the input to make decisions. In this problem, we will see how attention mechanisms can be used to perform node classification of graph-structured data through the usage of Graph Attention Networks (GATs).\n",

    "The building block of the Graph Attention Network is the graph attention layer, which is a variant of the aggregation function . Let $N$ be the number of nodes and $F$ be the dimension of the feature vector for each node. The input to each graph attentional layer is a set of node features: $\\mathbf{h} = \\{\\overrightarrow{h_1}, \\overrightarrow{h_2}, \\dots, \\overrightarrow{h_N}$\\}, $\\overrightarrow{h_i} \\in R^F$. The output of each graph attentional layer is a new set of node features, which may have a new dimension $F'$: $\\mathbf{h'} = \\{\\overrightarrow{h_1'}, \\overrightarrow{h_2'}, \\dots, \\overrightarrow{h_N'}\\}$, with $\\overrightarrow{h_i'} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{F'}$.\n",

We use a shared attentional mechanism:\n",

    "# 2 DeepSNAP Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous Colabs we used both of graph class (NetworkX) and tensor (PyG) representations of graphs separately. The graph class `nx.Graph` provides rich analysis and manipulation functionalities, such as the clustering coefficient and PageRank. To feed the graph into the model, we need to transform the graph into tensor representations including edge tensor `edge_index` and node attributes tensors `x` and `y`. But only using tensors (as the graphs formatted in PyG `datasets` and `data`) will make many graph manipulations and analysis less efficient and harder. So, in this Colab we will use DeepSNAP which combines both representations and offers a full pipeline for GNN training / validation / testing.\n"

    "1. DeepSNAP is easy to be used for the sophisticated graph manipulations, such as feature computation, pretraining, subgraph extraction etc. during/before the training.\n",
    "2. In most frameworks, standard pipelines for node, edge, link, graph-level tasks under inductive or transductive settings are left to the user to code. In practice, there are additional design choices involved (such as how to split dataset for link prediction). DeepSNAP provides such a standard pipeline that greatly saves repetitive coding efforts, and enables fair comparision for models.\n",
